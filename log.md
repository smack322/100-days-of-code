# 100 Days Of Code - Log

### Day 1: July 27, 2020 - 1hr

**Today's Progress**: Started bootcamp blog to help students. I created a navbar and space out the lis with css grid. I'm still learning how to align elements on the page. 

**Thoughts:** I struggled with picking up how to align items on the page with CSS Grid. I'll continue to work through the spacing and alignment tomorrow for the blog.

**Today's Progress**: Continued to work on blog. Added icons for social media, sections, asides, and more html structure.

**Today's Progress**: Added an image slider to the blog. Spaced out social media icons and added some padding to the container.

**Thoughts** The hardest part is getting start, but once you get 5 - 10 minutes in it becomes enjoyable.
