# 100 Days Of Code - Log

### Day 1: July 27, 2020 - 1hr

**Today's Progress**: Started bootcamp blog to help students. I created a navbar and space out the lis with css grid. I'm still learning how to align elements on the page. 

**Thoughts:** I struggled with picking up how to align items on the page with CSS Grid. I'll continue to work through the spacing and alignment tomorrow for the blog.

**Today's Progress**: Continued to work on blog. Added icons for social media, sections, asides, and more html structure.

**Thoughts**: Progress is slow but it was more enjoyable tonight. Still learning the ins and outs of CSS grid for the picture slider.

### Day 3: July 29, 2020 - 1hr

**Today's Progress**: Added an image slider to the blog. Spaced out social media icons and added some padding to the container.

**Thoughts** The hardest part is getting start, but once you get 5 - 10 minutes in it becomes enjoyable.

### Day 4: July 30, 2020 - 1hr

**Today's Progress**: Battled aligning my asides vertically. Had issues moving the asides outside of the grid system. Read a lot about CSS grid but not as much progress as I would have liked. I'll get back at it tomorrow.

**Thoughts** Sometimes it's worth reading through the docs / concepts vs googling for certain solutions. It helps to gain that baseline understanding first.

### Day 5: July 31, 2020 - 1hr

**Today's Progress**: Focused on some css styling to make the blog look more polished. I also learned out to rotate and make font awesome icons bigger. There is a lot of modifications you can do to the icons. 

**Thoughts** Just keep playing around with styling and css positioning until it falls into place.
