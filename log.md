# 100 Days Of Code - Log

### Day 1: July 27, 2020 - 1hr

**Today's Progress**: Started bootcamp blog to help students. I created a navbar and space out the lis with css grid. I'm still learning how to align elements on the page. 

**Thoughts:** I struggled with picking up how to align items on the page with CSS Grid. I'll continue to work through the spacing and alignment tomorrow for the blog.

**Today's Progress**: I've gone through many exercises on FreeCodeCamp.

**Thoughts** I've recently started coding, and it's a great feeling when I finally solve an algorithm challenge after a lot of attempts and hours spent.
