# 100 Days Of Code - Log

### Day 1: July 27, 2020 - 1hr

**Today's Progress**: Started bootcamp blog to help students. I created a navbar and space out the lis with css grid. I'm still learning how to align elements on the page. 

**Thoughts:** I struggled with picking up how to align items on the page with CSS Grid. I'll continue to work through the spacing and alignment tomorrow for the blog.

##### (delete me or comment me out)

**Today's Progress**: Continued to work on blog. Added icons for social media, sections, asides, and more html structure.

**Thoughts**: Progress is slow but it was more enjoyable tonight. Still learning the ins and outs of CSS grid for the picture slider.

### Day 3: July 29, 2020 - 1hr

**Today's Progress**: Added an image slider to the blog. Spaced out social media icons and added some padding to the container.

**Thoughts** The hardest part is getting start, but once you get 5 - 10 minutes in it becomes enjoyable.

### Day 4: July 30, 2020 - 1hr

**Today's Progress**: Battled aligning my asides vertically. Had issues moving the asides outside of the grid system. Read a lot about CSS grid but not as much progress as I would have liked. I'll get back at it tomorrow.

### Day 4: July 30, 2020 - 1hr

**Today's Progress**: Battled aligning my asides vertically. Had issues moving the asides outside of the grid system. Read a lot about CSS grid but not as much progress as I would have liked. I'll get back at it tomorrow.

**Thoughts** Sometimes it's worth reading through the docs / concepts vs googling for certain solutions. It helps to gain that baseline understanding first.

### Day 5: July 31, 2020 - 1hr

**Today's Progress**: Focused on some css styling to make the blog look more polished. I also learned out to rotate and make font awesome icons bigger. There is a lot of modifications you can do to the icons. 

**Thoughts** Just keep playing around with styling and css positioning until it falls into place.

### Day 6: August 2nd, 2020 - 1hr

**Today's Progress**: Spent the full 1hr reading up on CSS grid trying to figure out how to condense my columns into one for a small screen size. I am still looking into it.

**Thoughts** Sometimes you get stuck and things do not go as planned. It's important to try and pivot to another area of your website to try and get some traction.+

### Day 7: August 3rd, 2020 - 1hr

**Today's Progress**: Fixed the text inside the image slider so that it stays in sync when the browser screen size is adjusted. Made some progress on the asides as far as CSS styling.

**Thoughts** It only takes one small victory to keep your momentum going and the ball rolling. Try to solve an easier problem at the jump to get yourself in the zone.

### Day 8: August 4th, 2020 - 1hr

**Today's Progress**: Played around and got the media queries to work for the smaller screen sizes. Started to try and get some JS in place to shrink the navbar based on a smaller screen.

**Thoughts** It was good to learn more information about the different flex and grid positioning types.

### Day 9: August 7th, 2020 - 1hr

**Today's Progress**: Completed the CSS flex and most of the CSS grid sections on freecodecamp.com. Played around with trying to top right align my font awesome icons for the advertisement div.

**Thoughts** Randomly the light came on when it came to the media queries. What a great feeling!

### Day 10: August 8th, 2020 - 1hr

**Today's Progress**: Worked on API calls to the cloudforge API to bring back data on the CI account. Struggled getting the API calls to work through axios. I am thinking it had to do with Oauth / not having the app proxy setup. Good progress on looping through the JSON data to extract what I need for analysis.

**Thoughts** The core concepts are starting to take place which makes things a lot more easier to approach and to play around with now.

### Day 11: August 9th, 2020 - 1.5hr

**Today's Progress**: Learn some ES8 for how to loop through an object (turns the object into an array that you can then for loop through). Addes some code to write the data to a csv file to avoid all the copy / paste that I was doing from the console beforehand.

**Thoughts** Felt good about my progress today. All the data has been pulled and extracted into a csv which I'll look to do a join in MS Access based on the troux UUID.
